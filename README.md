# Smart-Plant-Watering-System

Now-a-days, in this age of advanced technology and electronics, the lifestyle of humans should
be smart, simpler, easier and much more convenient. Therefore, there is a need for many
automated systems in human’s daily life routine to make life easy. Here, an idea of one such
system named as automatic plant watering system is very useful. As many people are facing
a lot of problem watering the plants in the garden, especially when they are away from their
homes. This model uses sensor technologies with microcontroller in order to make a smart
switching device to help millions of people

To reduce the manual activity of watering plants, an idea of plant watering system is adopted.
The method employed monitors the soil moisture level continuously and decides whether watering is needed or not, and how much water is needed for the plant.
Essentially, system is designed and programmed in such way that the soil moisture sensor
senses the soil’s moisture level at a particular instance of time and if the moisture level of soil
is less than the specified value of threshold (which is predefined according to the particular
plant’s water need), then the desired amount of water is supplied till it reaches the predefined
threshold value.
The system reports its current soil moisture status and sends an alert to the user. The user can
view the soil moisture status on his/her mobile through the Virtuino application.
